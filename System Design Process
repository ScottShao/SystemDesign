System Design Process

Step 1: what's the constraints and use cases?

Example: Design a URL shorten services
1. What's the use cases?
	*Shortening: take an URL => return a much shorter URL
	*Redirection: take a short URL => redirect to original URL
	*Custom URL: allow user to pick their URL if it is not taken yet
	*High availability of the system
	
	There can be more use cases, which we should think of and verify with the interviewer
	*Analytics: allow user to look at the usage of URL
	*Automatic link expiration
	*Manual link removal
	*UI vs API: should we have a web site for that or just provide API for that
